[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CiaranWelsh/AntimonyCombinations.svg?branch=master)]

AntimonyCombinations is a package developed on top of [tellurium](http://tellurium.analogmachine.org/) and [antimony](http://antimony.sourceforge.net/) for building [sbml](http://sbml.org/Main_Page) models in a combinatorial fashion. The idea is that you have a core model which you are more confident in regarding its structure and an arbitrary number of additional hypotheses, called hypothesis extensions. `AntimonyCombinations` provides a way of quickly building the comprehensive set of model topologies, given the core hypothesis and hypothesis extensions.
